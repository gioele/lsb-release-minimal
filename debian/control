Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility (minimal implementation)
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 .
 This package contains a bare-bones implementation that uses the
 information in /etc/os-release instead of relying on LSB packages.
